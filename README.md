# Java-Wrapper-Nasa-Api

## Description
This is a Java wrapper for NASA's open API. 

***Note:*** I am using Ubuntu 16.04 to develop this API wrapper, and any instructions listed in this README have only been verified on Ubuntu 16.04. I can not guarantee the success of said instructions on other operating systems. Sorry for any inconvenience.

## Installation
***/0\/0\ In Progress***

## Getting Started 
* ### API Key
In order to utilize or contribute to this API wrapper, you first need to retrieve an API key. Follow the instructions at this [link](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key) get your API key. Once you have your API key, I recommend exporting it as an environment variable.

#### Recommended API Key storage options:

##### Option 1. Store as environment variable.

To permanently store your API key, open up a terminal window. Using the text editor of your choosing, open your ~/.bashrc file. Type the following, somewhere inside your ~/.bashrc file:

```export NASA_API_KEY=<your_nasa_key>``` 
Save the file. Then when back in the shell, source your ~/.bashrc file:

```source ~/.bashrc```

##### Option 2. Store in current shell session.

To temporarily store your API key in your current shell session, simply type into the terminal:

```export NASA_API_KEY=<your_nasa_key>```
